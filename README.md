### Acknowledgements
Our code relies on PyTorch, with [🤗 Diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) for diffusion model components
and [🤗 Accelerate](https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate) for multi-GPU training.\
We adopt [Stable Diffusion-v1.4](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4) as the base model and use
[SigLIP](https://huggingface.co/google/siglip-base-patch16-512) as the image encoder.\
For evaluation, we use [IQA_PyTorch](https://github.com/chaofengc/IQA-PyTorch),
[clean-fid](https://github.com/GaParmar/clean-fid),
and [DISTS-pytorch](https://github.com/dingkeyan93/DISTS).
